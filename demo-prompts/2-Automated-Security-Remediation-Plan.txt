# AWS Infrastructure Plan - Automated Security Remediation System


  The plan includes a multi-account security automation architecture with:

  Administrator Account Components:
  - AWS Config: Monitor compliance across accounts
  - AWS Security Hub: Aggregate security findings
  - AWS Findings: Security issue detection
  - EventBridge Hub: Custom actions for manual remediation
  - EventBridge Bus: Route security events automatically
  - Orchestrator Lambda: Coordinate remediation workflow
  - Security Lambda: Execute security-specific fixes
  - Step Functions: Manage complex remediation workflows
  - DynamoDB Table: Store remediation history
  - SNS Topic: Send notifications

  Member Account Components:
  - Orchestrator IAM Roles: Allow admin account to remediate issues
  - Control Runbook (SSM Document): Standardized remediation steps
  - Remediation Runbook (SSM Document): Specific fix procedures
  - KMS Key: Encrypt remediation data
  - Lambda Functions: Execute custom remediation logic
  - S3 Bucket: Store remediation logs
  - Other Resources: EC2, RDS, security groups being fixed

  How It Works:
  Step 1: Security services detect issues (Config, Security Hub)
  Step 2: EventBridge triggers remediation (manual or automatic)
  Step 3: Orchestrator Lambda coordinates the fix
  Step 4: Lambda assumes role in member account and executes remediation
  Step 5: Results stored in DynamoDB, notifications sent via SNS

  Traffic Flow:
  Security Finding → EventBridge → Orchestrator Lambda → Member Account
  IAM Role → SSM Runbook/Lambda → Fix Applied → Notification Sent

  The plan includes cross-account IAM roles, EventBridge rules for
  automated remediation, and manual triggers via Security Hub custom
  actions. All remediation actions are logged in DynamoDB and CloudTrail
  for audit purposes. The architecture supports automatic fixes (like
  blocking public S3 buckets) and manual approval workflows for sensitive
  changes.
