# E-Commerce Website - What We Need

## About Our Project
We're building an online shopping website that needs to handle lots of customers, keep their data safe, and work 24/7 without going down.

## What the website needs to do:

### Handle web traffic
- We expect lots of visitors shopping at the same time
- Need a load balancer to distribute traffic
- Website should work even if one server fails
- Want it in 2 different data centers for backup

### Store customer and product data
- Customer accounts and profiles
- Product catalog with prices
- Shopping cart and order history
- Need a database that's always available
- Database needs backup in case something goes wrong

### Store images and files
- Product photos (lots of them!)
- Customer profile pictures
- User uploaded reviews and photos
- Order receipts and invoices
- Need cheap storage that scales

### Keep everything secure
- Customer passwords need to be encrypted
- Payment information must be secure
- All data should be encrypted
- Need to detect if someone tries to hack us
- SSL certificates for HTTPS

### Monitor everything
- Know if website is slow or down
- Get alerts if something breaks
- Track errors and performance
- See logs when investigating problems
- Get notifications on our phones if critical issues

### Performance needs
- Website should load fast
- Product images should load quickly worldwide
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Handle Black Friday traffic spikes

### Data backup
- Daily database backups
- Keep backups for at least a week
- Store old data in cheaper archive storage

## Technical requirements (from our IT team):

### Network setup
- Private network for our servers (VPC)
- Separate sections for web servers and databases
- 2 availability zones for redundancy
- Internet access for web servers
- Databases should NOT be accessible from internet

### Servers
- Web application servers (can scale from 2 to 8 based on traffic)
- Application load balancer
- Auto-scaling when busy

### Database
- PostgreSQL database
- Multi-AZ (runs in 2 locations)
- 500 GB storage
- Weekly backups

### Storage buckets needed
1. Product images bucket - for all product photos
2. User uploads bucket - for customer uploaded content
3. Backups bucket - for database backups and logs

### Security requirements
- Encrypt everything (database, files, backups)
- Store passwords securely (not in code)
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Web application firewall to block attacks
- SSL/TLS certificates

### Monitoring requirements
- CloudWatch for monitoring server health
- Alerts for high CPU, memory, errors
- Distributed tracing to find slow parts
- Audit logs for compliance

### Other needs
- Content delivery network for fast image loading
- Shared storage for application files
- Cache layer for faster database queries
- Email notifications for system alerts

## Compliance
- Need to meet security standards
- Encrypt all customer data
- Keep audit logs
- Detect and prevent data breaches

# What this should generate:

The system should automatically figure out we need:
- VPC with public and private networks
- Load balancer and web servers
- PostgreSQL database (protected)
- S3 storage buckets (3 of them)
- CloudWatch monitoring
- KMS encryption
- Secrets Manager for passwords
- GuardDuty for security
- X-Ray for performance tracking
- CloudFront for fast image delivery
- Shared file storage (EFS)
- Security certificates
- WAF protection

Everything should be encrypted, monitored, and highly available!
