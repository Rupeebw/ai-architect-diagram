# Minimal Test - Bare Bones Architecture

## Purpose
Test the absolute minimum configuration and auto-include behavior.

## Infrastructure

### Network
- VPC with 2 Availability Zones
- Public and private subnets

### Compute
- ALB
- EC2 instances

### Database
- RDS MySQL

---

## Testing Instructions

```bash
/draw-aws-diagram /Users/rupeshpanwar/Documents/PProject/schild/architecture/demo/5-minimal-test.txt
```

**Purpose**: Test auto-include behavior

Expected layers:
- ✅ Core Infrastructure (VPC, EC2, RDS, ALB)
- ✅ Observability (CloudWatch, CloudTrail - AUTO-INCLUDED)
- ✅ Security (KMS, Secrets Manager - AUTO-INCLUDED)

Expected: Even with minimal input, security and monitoring should be auto-added!

This tests: "Production architectures MUST have encryption and monitoring"
