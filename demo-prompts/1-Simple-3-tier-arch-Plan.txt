# AWS Infrastructure Plan - VPC with Public/Private Subnets


  The plan includes a production-ready AWS VPC architecture with:

  Network Components:
  - 1 VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
  - 2 Public Subnets (for ALB and NAT Gateways)
  - 2 Private Subnets (for EC2 and RDS)
  - 1 Internet Gateway
  - 2 NAT Gateways (one per AZ for high availability)
  - 3 Route Tables (1 public, 2 private)

  Compute & Database:
  - EC2 instances in private subnets (Auto Scaling Group)
  - RDS database in private subnets (Multi-AZ)

  User Access via:
  - Route 53: DNS resolution (app.example.com)
  - ACM: SSL/TLS certificates
  - ALB: Load balancing across EC2 instances in private subnets

  Traffic Flow:
  User → Route 53 → ALB (with ACM cert) → EC2 (private) → RDS
  (private)

  The plan also includes security groups, deployment order,
  monitoring recommendations, and cost optimization tips. Note
  that I've placed EC2 instances in private subnets (not public)
  as this is the security best practice, with the ALB in public
  subnets handling internet-facing traffic.
